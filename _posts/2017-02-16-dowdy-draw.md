### About The Hike

Well this is the hike that might keep me from 52 hike this year.

The hike was great enough. Nice warm day, empty trail, beautiful stars. Everything you want in a nice hike.

The first half was very uneventful. Just a normal hike. Nice wind, empty trail. Great times, but on the loop back I looked up and heard something that turned out to be a elk snorting at me. I yelled, and he took off. 

A few more steps down though, my headlamp caught the eye of a coyote. I made some more noise and the coyote left, but I started jogged just to get out of the area I was in. As I was jogging, I looked back to see if I could see the eyes, and as I was doing so rolled my ankle something fierce. 

I was able to walk out, thinking everything was fine, but the next morning it was in tons of pain, and here I am a week later still wearing a brace with a good amount of pain. So I'm a week behind on hiking. Which is a shame, but hopefully I will heal up soon. No one is a big fan of being in pain, or being behind on a personal challenge this early in the season.
