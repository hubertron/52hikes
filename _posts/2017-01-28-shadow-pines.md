### About The Hike

The weather for this hike couldn't be better. Right around 60 degrees, with a small breeze and full sun. This is one of the reason' I love Colorado. You can go from -18 out to 60 degrees and have a chance to feel like a human again. I decided to take the dog on this journey again. He is getting much better at hiking, and has become more of a joy than ever. He just celebrated his first birthday and hasn't slowed down at all.

This was a pretty easy hike with only {{ page.gain }} of elevation gain even a flatlander can tackle, but with the snow, the dog and the conditions I couldn't have a better time.

There is something about walking through lodgepole pines with snow on the ground that just makes life worth living.

The trail wasn't super packed and the people I did encounter on it were very nice. Everyone was enjoying the day. It's a nice break from city life and only took about 40 minutes to get to from Denver.
