### About The Hike

We started off planning to hike another trail, until we saw the no dogs allowed sign so we picked this one as a backup. We have both hiked this before and really enjoy the variety of terrain and varied views.

There is alot of uphill here, but the trail isn't at a very high elevation and is gained over a good distance so the hiking was pretty easy.

The trail covers it all. It goes along a stream, along a ridge, through a lodgepole forest and has alot of views.

It was a very nice hike and perfect for weekend. This will always be a go to hike for me.
