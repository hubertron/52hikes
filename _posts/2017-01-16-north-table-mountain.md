## About The Hike

This was a bit of an impromptu hike for me. I was gonna head up to the mountains for a day of skiing but given that it was Martin Luther King Jr's day the traffic was insane. So instead I decided to grab the puppy, who isn't so young anymore and take him for his first long hike.

The initial plan was to do something small. 4 miles or so but I didn't read any of the distances on the topo map, so what I thought was small turned into something alot longer than I wanted to do, mainly because I didn't have alot of water for the dog and I and it was around lunch time. Luckily the pupper was up for it all. I figured I was gonna have to carry him but he got on just fine. I love that guy.

What I really like about this hike other than it's proximity to Denver is that you get a great view of Denver, even when Denver is enveloped in that [Brown Cloud](https://www.stevespanglerscience.com/blog/2013/02/18/the-science-behind-denvers-brown-cloud/) phenomenon that we have.

It's also pretty cool that they re-purposed what was a quarry into an area for hikers and rock climbers. It creates what my wife calls a bit of a moonscape.

On the way back to the car I had to laugh. There were 2 couples finishing up just ahead of me that were spending an obsessive amount of time cleaning the mud off their boots. One guy ran and got sticks to pick out the mud, another person took a pile of snow and threw it on the ground and was stomping on it, the 3rd was doing the classic scraping it on the curb and the 4th lady changed from her hiking boots to heels. So literally in full hiking attire, smartwool socks and all wearing high heels! The 4 of them had to have spent 10 minutes just cleaning their boots off. It was pretty ridiculous. Hopefully they have a safe flight back to LA. ðŸ˜¼âœˆ
