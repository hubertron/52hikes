## Why Hike

This was the hike that inspired this site and this challenge. It's not this that hike was any better than any other hike I have done. It's just that I reminded me that I live in Colorado and last year I barely went on any hikes. 

If I think about why, I can make a hundred excused (too busy, new puppy, work, etc) but it really comes down to just laziness. I live a 10 min walk from a great little lake and I don't have a good excuse for not at least visiting it once a week. So this year I am going to go on a hike a week. I will mainly stick to the Denver area and area's surrounding it. I tend to travel a good amount so you might see hikes in Vermont, Utah, New York but generally these hikes will stick to Colorado.

## About The Hike

This tends to be a pretty busy trail, with alot of dogs and a small parking lot. Being January it was certainly a bit quieter and it was easy to find a parking spot. There are about 30 spots here including parking on the side.

Despite it being very sunny and warm, and super warm for about a week there was still plenty of snow :snowflake: on the trails, anytime the trail didn't face south there was snow. So about 60% of the trail looked like this.

It was slippery enough that I encountered maybe a dozen people that turned back. It was very slippery but luckily I had good boots and plenty of nerve for not having good balance. 

Once we got around the bend the trail dried out and started to look a lot more like this.

And given the clear skies I even get a pretty great view of Denver about 20 miles away.

All in all it was a great hike and worth checking out. Once it dries completely it might be good to do at night.
