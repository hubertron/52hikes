### About The Hike

We got quite a few inches of snow right before this hike so I didn't want do a hike up in the hills for fear of ice, mud and generally disagreeable trail conditions. This park is south south Denver I never had a chance to check out. It's a pretty typical Denver park - ballfields, lots of dogs and a river running through it. The big highlight of this trip however was that we saw a Coyote on the trail ahead of us maybe 100 yards. Of course I tried to get a photo but given the distance and the coyotes camouflage he ended up being well hidden from the camera.


I don't consider this much of a hike as it only was an hour, was mostly flat and in a city park, but it served its purpose of getting me out of the house and enjoying the sunny weather. Hike 2 is in the books!

If you squint really hard you can see the coyote there.
