### About The Hike

This hike was adventurous just to get to! On the way to the trailhead a car flipped upside down. On a dry road. It had to be that they wre going to fast. There were plenty of police and fire on the scene. It didn't appear anyone got seriously hurt.

Finding the trailhead was the next challenge. We drove past it 3 times before we finally found it. Here is a photo of it if you want to try it in the winter as well.

The trail was completely snow covered, but it wasn't icy and it was packed down really well. Just normal hiking boots were all we needed to get to the top.

The views were great for most of the short trail, they rivaled some 14ers I have tackled.

It was a pretty easy hike, but once we broke above the treeline for the final push it got really really windy and I didn't have the right gear so my ears were freezing.

Once we got to the top, I hid behind some rocks to stay out of the wind and took some time to take in the view.

The trip back included a short glissade with the dog down a steep slope and then the hike out. It was a great day and I look forward to doing it again in the summer.
